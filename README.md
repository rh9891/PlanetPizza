## Description

Planet Pizza is a fun and interactive pizza-themed website that allows users to explore the pizza menu, view details about various options, and engage with different sections through a smooth, dynamic interface. The website is built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and visually appealing user experience.

Key features include a responsive navigation menu that opens with a hamburger icon (in smaller devices), smooth scrolling between sections, a dark mode toggle, and animated content that fades or slides into view using ScrollReveal.js, enhancing the overall interactivity and polish of the site.
